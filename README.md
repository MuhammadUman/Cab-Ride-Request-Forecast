# Cab-Ride-Request-Forecast
It helps cab services predict ride demand more accurately. By analyzing historical data, including time, day, events and weather. It can forecast when and where rides will be needed. This helps manage driver availability, reduce wait times and improve service during busy hours.In this article, we will try to predict ride-request for a particular hour using machine learning.

The model itself is not perfect, but its a demo project so i can get my hands on the entire machine learning thing.

You need to install all the libraries i have used in the code for it to work as well as also un-comment the code in case you wanna see behind the work and the graphs.
